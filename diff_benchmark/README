Performance benchmark for simplified diffusion kernel

diff.py has both the call to the python and cython version
compile Cython version with "python setup.py build_ext --inplace"

Results (on Macbook, with GCC 4.9.3), "relative" is speedup/slowdown compared to C++

		time/iter [s]  iters   relative
