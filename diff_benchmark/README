diff.py has both the call to the python and cython version
compile Cython version with "python setup.py build_ext --inplace"

Results:
overhead  = time script without calling diffusion kernel
time      = time script with calling diffusion
loop time = time minus overhead
iters     = number of times diffusion called
time/iter = net time per diffusion call

code    overhead  time   loop time  iters	time/iter
